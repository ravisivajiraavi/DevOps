### 1. **What is a function in Python?**
   A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow code to be organized, reused, and easily maintained. A function can accept input (called arguments or parameters), process it, and optionally return a result. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}!"
   ```

### 2. **What are the types of functions in Python?**
   There are two main types of functions in Python:
   - **Built-in Functions**: Functions that are predefined in Python (e.g., `print()`, `len()`, `abs()`).
   - **User-defined Functions**: Functions created by the user using the `def` keyword.
   
   Additionally, Python supports **anonymous functions** (lambda functions) and **recursive functions** (functions that call themselves).

### 3. **What is the purpose of the return statement in Python?**
   The `return` statement is used to exit a function and pass a value back to the caller. Without a `return` statement, the function will return `None` by default.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b
   ```

### 4. **What are default arguments in Python functions?**
   Default arguments are parameters that assume a default value if no argument is provided during the function call. They allow functions to be called with fewer arguments.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   def greet(name, msg="Hello"):
       return f"{msg}, {name}!"
   greet("John")  # Output: "Hello, John!"
   ```

### 5. **What is a lambda function in Python?**
   A lambda function is an anonymous, small, single-expression function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. It is defined using the `lambda` keyword.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   add = lambda x, y: x + y
   ```

### 6. **How is a lambda function different from a regular function in Python?**
   - A **lambda function** is limited to a single expression, whereas a **regular function** can have multiple lines of code.
   - Lambda functions do not have a name, and they are often used for short, simple operations. Regular functions are more versatile and can handle complex logic.

### 7. **Give an example of using a lambda function with the map() function.**
   The `map()` function applies a lambda (or any function) to every item in an iterable (like a list).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
   print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
   ```

### 8. **How do you open a file in Python?**
   You can open a file using the `open()` function. The syntax is:
   ```python
   file = open('filename', 'mode')
   ```
   The `mode` specifies how the file should be opened (read, write, append, etc.).

### 9. **What are the different file modes in Python?**
   - `'r'`: Read (default mode)
   - `'w'`: Write (truncates the file if it exists)
   - `'a'`: Append (writes to the end of the file)
   - `'rb'`: Read in binary mode
   - `'wb'`: Write in binary mode
   - `'r+'`: Read and write
   
### 10. **What is the with statement used for in file handling?**
   The `with` statement is used to automatically handle file closing after the file operations are completed, ensuring that resources are properly released even if an error occurs.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

### 11. **How can you write to a file in Python?**
   You can write to a file using the `write()` or `writelines()` methods.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
       file.write("Hello, World!")
   ```

### 12. **How can you read specific lines from a file?**
   You can use `readline()` or `readlines()` to read specific lines.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
       line1 = file.readline()
       all_lines = file.readlines()  # reads all lines into a list
   ```

### 13. **How do you handle exceptions while dealing with files in Python?**
   Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like file not found, permission errors, etc.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   try:
       with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
           content = file.read()
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("File not found.")
   ```

### 14. **How can you use a Python lambda function to process logs from a log file?**
   Lambda functions can be used to process each line of a log file. For example, you can filter logs based on specific patterns.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   with open('logfile.txt', 'r') as file:
       error_logs = filter(lambda line: 'ERROR' in line, file)
       for log in error_logs:
           print(log)
   ```

### 15. **Explain how lambda functions could be used to dynamically update configuration files in a pipeline.**
   In CI/CD pipelines, lambda functions can process configuration files to adjust settings before deployment. For instance, a lambda could replace placeholder values with actual configuration parameters.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   update_config = lambda line: line.replace('PLACEHOLDER', 'ACTUAL_VALUE')
   ```

### 16. **How would you use a Python lambda function to automate the cleanup of old backup files in a DevOps pipeline?**
   A lambda function could filter out files older than a certain date and remove them using the `os` module.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import os
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   cleanup_old_files = lambda file: os.remove(file) if datetime.now() - os.path.getmtime(file) > timedelta(days=30) else None
   ```
### 17. **How can you use Python to read a configuration file, modify some settings, and write the updated values back to the file in a CI/CD pipeline?**
   In a CI/CD pipeline, you might need to modify configuration files before deployment. You can use Python to read, modify, and update these files, especially when working with formats like `.ini`, `.json`, `.yaml`.

   **Example** (modifying a `.ini` file):
   ```python
   import configparser

   config = configparser.ConfigParser()
   config.read('config.ini')

   # Modify the settings
   config['DEFAULT']['debug'] = 'False'

   # Write changes back to the file
   with open('config.ini', 'w') as configfile:
       config.write(configfile)
   ```

### 18. **Describe how you would handle log rotation using Python for a DevOps use case.**
   Log rotation involves creating new log files after a certain size or time threshold is reached, archiving old logs, and keeping disk usage in check. You can use Python to check log file sizes, rotate logs, and delete older files.

   **Example** (log rotation by file size):
   ```python
   import os
   import shutil

   def rotate_logs(logfile, max_size):
       if os.path.getsize(logfile) > max_size:
           shutil.move(logfile, logfile + '.old')
           open(logfile, 'w').close()  # Clear the original log file

   rotate_logs('app.log', 10*1024*1024)  # Rotate if size > 10 MB
   ```

### 19. **How can Python file handling be used to automate deployment by updating an `.env` file with new environment variables?**
   In a deployment pipeline, you might need to update `.env` files with dynamic environment variables like database URLs or API keys. Python can be used to modify or add these variables in `.env` files.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   def update_env_file(filepath, env_vars):
       with open(filepath, 'a') as file:
           for key, value in env_vars.items():
               file.write(f"{key}={value}\n")

   new_vars = {"API_KEY": "abc123", "DB_URL": "db.example.com"}
   update_env_file('.env', new_vars)
   ```

### 20. **How can you read log files in Python and trigger an alert if certain patterns (e.g., error messages) are found?**
   Python can scan log files for error patterns and trigger an alert (e.g., by sending an email or logging the error).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   def check_log_for_errors(logfile, pattern):
       with open(logfile, 'r') as file:
           for line in file:
               if pattern in line:
                   print(f"Alert: Error found -> {line}")

   check_log_for_errors('logfile.txt', 'ERROR')
   ```

### 21. **How can you use Pythonâ€™s file handling to back up Kubernetes YAML files before applying updates to your cluster?**
   Before applying updates, you can use Python to back up YAML configuration files by copying them to a backup directory.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import shutil
   import os

   def backup_yaml_files(yaml_dir, backup_dir):
       if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
           os.makedirs(backup_dir)
       for filename in os.listdir(yaml_dir):
           if filename.endswith('.yaml'):
               shutil.copy(os.path.join(yaml_dir, filename), backup_dir)

   backup_yaml_files('/path/to/yamls', '/path/to/backup')
   ```

### 22. **Explain how to use Python lambda functions within a Jenkins pipeline for quick config transformations before deployment.**
   In a Jenkins pipeline, lambda functions can be used to apply quick transformations to configuration files or data. For instance, you could modify environment-specific configurations just before deploying.

   **Example** (within a Python script):
   ```python
   transform = lambda config: config.replace('STAGING_URL', 'PRODUCTION_URL')
   
   with open('config.yaml', 'r+') as file:
       content = file.read()
       updated_content = transform(content)
       file.seek(0)
       file.write(updated_content)
   ```

### 23. **How can you use a lambda function to automate the transformation of data retrieved from an API before storing it in a configuration file?**
   You can use a lambda function to process data returned from an API and store it in a config file in the required format (e.g., JSON or YAML).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import json
   import requests

   api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
   response = requests.get(api_url)
   data = response.json()

   transform_data = lambda d: {k.lower(): v for k, v in d.items()}

   # Transform and save the data
   transformed_data = transform_data(data)
   with open('config.json', 'w') as config_file:
       json.dump(transformed_data, config_file)
   ```

### 24. **How would you use lambda functions to filter out specific lines in a large log file in a DevOps pipeline?**
   Lambda functions can filter out unwanted lines from a log file (e.g., to keep only error messages or warnings).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   with open('large_log.txt', 'r') as file:
       error_logs = filter(lambda line: 'ERROR' in line, file)
       for log in error_logs:
           print(log)
   ```

### 25. **How can you use a Python lambda function to perform dynamic scaling of cloud resources based on metrics?**
   A lambda function can be used in combination with monitoring metrics (e.g., CPU usage) to trigger scaling actions in the cloud.

   **Example** (pseudo code for AWS auto-scaling):
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('autoscaling')

   scale_up = lambda metric: client.update_auto_scaling_group(AutoScalingGroupName='my-asg', DesiredCapacity=metric['desired_capacity']) if metric['cpu'] > 80 else None
   ```

### 26. **How can you use Python to create automated backups of configuration files during every deployment?**
   Python can automate the backup of configuration files by copying them to a specific backup directory before deployment.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import shutil
   import os

   def backup_config(config_file, backup_dir):
       if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
           os.makedirs(backup_dir)
       shutil.copy(config_file, backup_dir)

   backup_config('/path/to/config.yaml', '/path/to/backup')
   ```

### 27. **How can you automate the parsing of log files to extract specific data using Python file handling and lambda functions?**
   You can use a combination of file handling and lambda functions to extract data from log files based on patterns or criteria.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   extract_errors = lambda line: line.split(' ')[2] if 'ERROR' in line else None

   with open('logfile.txt', 'r') as file:
       for line in file:
           error = extract_errors(line)
           if error:
               print(error)
   ```

### 28. **How can you programmatically update a YAML configuration file before deployment using Python?**
   You can use the `PyYAML` library to read, modify, and update YAML configuration files before deployment.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import yaml

   with open('config.yaml', 'r') as file:
       config = yaml.safe_load(file)

   config['setting']['debug'] = False  # Modify the setting

   with open('config.yaml', 'w') as file:
       yaml.safe_dump(config, file)
   ```

### 29. **How can Python help you track changes in configuration files and send an alert if any modifications are detected?**
   Python can track changes by comparing file hashes or contents, and if a modification is detected, it can trigger an alert (e.g., sending an email or logging an event).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import hashlib

   def get_file_hash(file_path):
       with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
           return hashlib.md5(file.read()).hexdigest()

   original_hash = get_file_hash('config.yaml')

   # After some operation
   new_hash = get_file_hash('config.yaml')

   if original_hash != new_hash:
       print("Alert: Configuration file has changed!")
   ```
